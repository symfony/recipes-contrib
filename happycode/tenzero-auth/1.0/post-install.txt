Thanks for installing Happycode TenZeroAuth!

Next steps (recommended):

1) Configure the bundle
   Add a config file (or edit your existing one):
     config/packages/happycode_tenzero_auth.yaml

   Minimal example:

    happycode_tenzero_auth:
        user_class: App\Entity\User
        user_field: email

   Notes:
   - user_class must be your Doctrine User entity class.
   - user_field is the identifier field used for login (e.g. "email" or "username").

2) Ensure your User entity is compatible
   Your App\Entity\User should extend the bundle base user model provided by TenZeroAuth.
   If you haven’t created your User entity yet, generate it (or update it) accordingly

3) JWT keys / env vars
   This bundle expects JWT configuration via environment variables.
   Add these to your .env.local (values are placeholders):

     JWT_SECRET_KEY="[%PROJECT_DIR%]/config/jwt/private.pem"
     JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="[%PROJECT_DIR%]/config/jwt/public.pem"
     JWT_PASSPHRASE="<your-passphrase>"

   Then generate the keypair (if you haven’t already), e.g. using the tooling recommended
   by your JWT bundle, and ensure the files exist at the configured paths.

4) Database / migrations
   If this recipe adds entities or mapping, generate & run migrations:

     php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
     php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

5) Routes / UI
   After install, you should have auth endpoints available (login/logout, and optionally register).
   Start your server and verify the auth screens load correctly.

6) Optional: customize
   You can override defaults such as:
   - theme
   - app_name / app_description
   - enable_register
   - login_redirect_url / logout_redirect_url
   - token_ttl, reset_password_link_ttl
   - access_control overrides (advanced)

If something doesn’t work, double-check:
- Your user_class exists and autoloads
- Your user_class is the expected base type for this bundle
- Your user_field exists on the user (property or getter)
- JWT keys and passphrase are correct
