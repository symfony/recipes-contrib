    into your database. Currently, only MySQL is supported. To import the tables,
    use the following command from your project root:

    <fg=green>php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --configuration=vendor/netgen/layouts-core/migrations/doctrine.yml</>

  * Enable ESI and fragments support in the <fg=green>config/packages/framework.yaml</> file.
