<info>Fastfony/IdentityBundle is almost ready:</info>

1. A <fg=yellow>config/packages/fastfony_identity.yaml</> and a <fg=yellow>config/routes/fastfony_identity.yaml</> file has been created for you.

2. The <fg=yellow>config/packages/security.yaml</> and <fg=yellow>config/packages/stof_doctrine_extensions.yaml</> file have been edited for you.

3. Merge the content of <fg=yellow>config/packages/mailer.yaml.dist</> into your <fg=yellow>config/packages/mailer.yaml</> file and set your <fg=yellow>MAILER_DSN</> environment variable if it is not already done.

4. Create the database schema:

    Option 1 - Generate and run migrations to create the database tables:

    <fg=green>php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate</>

    Option 2 - Or without migrations ,you can create the schema directly :

    <fg=green>php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force</>
